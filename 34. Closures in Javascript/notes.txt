closure

1_scope
    - since result was declared inside function, therefore after it's execution it's no more available.

2_lexical_scope
    - child function has access to parent function's scope, therefore 'a' is accessible from child function.

3_closure
    - even after execution of parent function, it's removed from stack, child function has accessed to parent's variables.
    - this is k/a closure.
    - a function is always bundled with it's lexical scope.
