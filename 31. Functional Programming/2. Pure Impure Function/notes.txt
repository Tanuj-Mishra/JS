Impure Function
    - Function whose result depends upon external factors.
        i.e, function returns different returns for same set of argument.

Pure Function
    - Just reverse of impure function.
    - Function will return same result for same set of arguments.

Side effects
    - If a function is changing the environment(state must not be mutated), then it is k/a as sideeffects.
    - Although, it is advisible to use pure function without sideeffects, but it's practically almost impossible to do so.
        So try to code, having very less number of side effects.
